# Convergence of Langevin-Simulated Annealing algorithms with multiplicative noise
[arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11669)

The notebook simulations-langevin-simulated-annealing.ipynb shows how to use the source code for the experiments.

The file optimizers.py codes the Langevin versions of the usual optimization algorithms.

The machine learning library that is used is TensorFlow.
